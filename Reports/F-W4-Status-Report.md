# Sprint Goal

Finish off any zero-day items for setup and develop simple yet creative light sequences to demonstrate setup completion.

# Discussion

## Key Meetings

* Monday 2020-09-28 - Standup
* Thursday 2020-10-01 - Draft Status Report

## Findings

* Matt K. informed us that when an LED burns out it can cascade down the strip resulting in the flickering lights we've encountered over the past week. Sisyphus Industries will be sending replacement LED strips.

## Successes

* Andy and Grace assigned a static IP to the table in preparation to make it available for remote login via the MSOE VPN.
* Andy configured `pylint` to ensure good Python practices
* Stuart configured `pytest` as scaffolding to start writing out a testing suite for the team's changes.
* A majority of the team has received their SD cards and NeoPixel LED strips to enable local development.

## Risk Updates

* MSOE IT has yet to tunnel the table to be accessible over MSOE VPN.
* More hardware is needed to run the strips than initially thought which means safe local development is delayed still.

# Questions

* How uncouth is it to refactor parts of the code base with better practices and patterns?

# Conclusion

The team feels demotivated because they don't have the materials to begin working on PBIs (and it's Week 4!), but are looking forward to jumping into things once everything is delivered. The team does not like to be  beholden to MSOE IT or UPS/USPS. We are trying to make the most of this week by expanding our knowledge and completing tasks that don't require Pis and LED strips.
