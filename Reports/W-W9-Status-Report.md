| 2021-02-09 | casperjm | 4h | Met with stuart to figure out how to edit the web app so that we could add a checkbox to turn on mood lighting. This took a very long time because the code is very messy and difficult to understand. The checkbox itself can toggle, but its onchange function won't call | #41 | msoe-sisbot |
| 2021-02-10 | casperjm | 1h | Met with Grace to try to get the function to call, and couldn't figure it out. | #41 | msoe-sisbot |
| 2021-02-10 | casperjm | 2h | Met with Grace and George to do more in depth debugging, made some progress in figuring out _why_ it isn't working, but we still can't find a way to get it to run. Adding the onchange of the new checkbox to an old checkbox causes the new function to run, but the new function will not run on the new checkbox. | #41 | msoe-sisbot |

This week, I spent all my time trying to finihs up my ticket to add a checkbox to the app that will let the user turn on the mood lighting mode. I met with Stuart, Grace, and George for help, but the four of us could not get the function to be called.

| 2021-02-06 | #Grace Fleming | 1.67h       | Worked with Andy on troubleshooting the demo. Recording audio raw was much better on his phone, which is a newer model. The woes of audio procesing on Android proved to be too great to overcome; without a good linear algebra library to perform computations on the raw audio signal normalizing and scaling the audio proved to be a challenge. Even after performing the normalization operation manually, there was still a difference between the MFCC values given by PyAudioAnalysis and the integrated audio analysis library JLibrosa. While other libraries for audio feature extraction exist in Java, the difficulties with attempting to match the size and scale of the features extracted by PyAudioAnalysis would be quite difficult. Having poured two weeks of a 3-week sprint into attempting to gather 1 feature from an audio sample on mobile, the team felt that it was time to switch to a different approach. The JVM is not designed for fast machine learning and is not capable of doing high-fidelity (or possibly any-fidelity) audio processing. Finally, although PyAudioAnalysis stands a chance of being ported to Java directly, this would be a labor-intensive operation. Therefore, Andy and I both agreed it was time to switch our focus to a different approach; this one is not going to be feasible. | Spike: Mood lighting & Mobile as a Artificial Intelligence Computation Platform | msoe-sisbot |

| 2021-02-08 | #Grace Fleming | 1.50h       | Spent significant time looking through server.js in sisproxy with relation to ansible.js and subsequently, to the server.js and sisbot.js in the sisbot repository. I learned that the sisbot module not only communicates with the lights, but also communicates with the table (the ball) over a serial connection. It communicates with the lights using a system socket (we already knew this). I dislike how large the sisbot.js service is; it REALLY should be broken down. I hate the idea of adding anything to it. I do think, however, that this module would be the correct place to add on functionality to enabling/disabling light modes if we are going to have to handle a web request being the seam for enabling/disabling the mood lighting or beat detection feature. I don't necessarily believe we should add to sisbot.js, but I would be down for breaking it out and simply requireing it into sisbot.js.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Create First-Pass Architecture Draft                                            | msoe-sisbot |

| 2021-02-09 | #Grace Fleming | 2h          | Looked through siscloud and determined that the web application is independent on its own; Cordova is needed only to package the web application to Android/iOS. This solved a huge swath of personal confusion with the repository. Without the Cordova mess in the picture, the app is simply a (spaghettilike) web codebase. Grace's findings about how the flow of control transfers between sisproxy to siscloud and from serverside to clientside are documented in the wiki.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Create First-Pass Architecture Draft                                            | msoe-sisbot |
| 2021-02-10 | Grace Fleming  | 1h45m       | Troubleshot with Joe on why his toggle wasn't working. Necessary to have me because a manual person near the lab was required to utilize the web interface (only works on same network as table currently).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Spike: Mood Lighting & Integration                                              | msoe-sisbot |

# Discussion

## Key Meetings
* Meeting with Dr. Taylor 2021-02-05 to discuss sprint progress
* Team meeting (stand up and check in) on 2021-02-08
* Team meeting (stand-up and end of sprint activities) on 2021-02-11

## Findings
* Latency is pretty minimal when streaming data to an external web service

## Successes
* We drew out a first-pass architecture of the new planned module.
* We got all of the things that we planned for this sprint done or nearly done.
* People did a really good job of helping each other out this week.

## Risk Updates
* Even modifying something really simple in siscloud is risky.
* LEDs have started to burn out again on the table.

# Questions
* Do you want to come to one of our morale boosting activities?

# Conclusion
Now that we have an idea for an initial architecture we're excited to actually move into developing a product.
