## Findings
* Latency is pretty minimal when streaming data to an external web service

## Successes
* We drew out a first-pass architecture of the new planned module.
* We got all of the things that we planned for this sprint done or nearly done.
* People did a really good job of helping each other out this week.

## Risk Updates
* Even modifying something really simple in siscloud is risky.
* LEDs have started to burn out again on the table.

# Questions
* Do you want to come to one of our morale boosting activities?

# Conclusion
Now that we have an idea for an initial architecture we're excited to actually move into developing a product.
