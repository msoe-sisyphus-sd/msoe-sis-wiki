| 2021-02-08 | casperjm | 2h | Weekly stand up; made a rough architecture draft for the upcoming project | #7 | msoe-sisbot |
| 2021-02-09 | casperjm | 4h | Met with stuart to figure out how to edit the web app so that we could add a checkbox to turn on mood lighting. This took a very long time because the code is very messy and difficult to understand. The checkbox itself can toggle, but its onchange function won't call | #41 | msoe-sisbot |
| 2021-02-10 | casperjm | 1h | Met with Grace to try to get the function to call, and couldn't figure it out. | #41 | msoe-sisbot |
| 2021-02-10 | casperjm | 2h | Met with Grace and George to do more in depth debugging, made some progress in figuring out _why_ it isn't working, but we still can't find a way to get it to run. Adding the onchange of the new checkbox to an old checkbox causes the new function to run, but the new function will not run on the new checkbox. | #41 | msoe-sisbot |

This week, I spent all my time trying to finihs up my ticket to add a checkbox to the app that will let the user turn on the mood lighting mode. I met with Stuart, Grace, and George for help, but the four of us could not get the function to be called.

# Discussion

## Key Meetings
* Meeting with Dr. Taylor 2021-02-05 to discuss sprint progress
* Team meeting (stand up and check in) on 2021-02-08
* Team meeting (stand-up and end of sprint activities) on 2021-02-11

## Findings
* Latency is pretty minimal when streaming data to an external web service

## Successes
* We drew out a first-pass architecture of the new planned module.
* We got all of the things that we planned for this sprint done or nearly done.
* People did a really good job of helping each other out this week.

## Risk Updates
* Even modifying something really simple in siscloud is risky.
* LEDs have started to burn out again on the table.

# Questions
* Do you want to come to one of our morale boosting activities?

# Conclusion
Now that we have an idea for an initial architecture we're excited to actually move into developing a product.
