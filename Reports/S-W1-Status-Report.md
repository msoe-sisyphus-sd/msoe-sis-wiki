# Discussion

## Key Meetings
* 2021/02/25 - Met with Bruce to show him our findings (no demo)
* 2021/03/09 - weekly sync meeting & some architecting (see new diagram at bottom of First Pass Arch. wiki page)
* 2021/03/11 - weekly status report meeting, reviewed a PR for issue #56

## Findings
* Gitlab still hasn't fixed the reverse burndown issue
* vpn setup in linux is hard :(

## Successes
* Did a lot of architecting for our Tuesday sync meeting relative to sislisten's role and composition
* Andy set up automated testing in the sislisten repository 
* We were able to close PBI #56 thanks to Andy's work

## Risk Updates
* Lights flicker on the production table, suggesting burned-out LED's
* Possible issues with Heroku's wake-up latency (think about moving to ROSIE? What about long-term solution?)

# Questions
* Senior design show - how's that going to work? In-person?
* Do we make a physical poster or a virtual one?
* We are planning to finish this current sprint at the end of week 3, making this sprint a 3-week sprint. Are we approved for two-week sprints after that with the caveat of cutting down on the paperwork in some fashion (up for discussion)?

# Conclusion
The team is relieved that this is going to be their last quarter of MSOE (dear 18-year-old-me picking a school: MSOE is good for the future bank account in like 30 years after loans are paid off, bad for the soul/mental health/sleep schedule/etc). Architecture planning has been fun and the team feels like it's given them a clear picture of what to implement; the team is excited to produce an MVP by the end of week 3.
