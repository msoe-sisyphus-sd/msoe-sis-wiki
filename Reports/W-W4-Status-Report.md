# Sprint Goal

Original Goal: Investigate two new user-table domains to test feasibility and level of interactivity.

New Goal: Investigate mapping audio to colors and how to integrate a Python ML model with the existing code base.

# Discussion

## Key Meetings (including those over Winter Break)
* 2020-12-18: Met with Sisyphus Industries for Sprint Review
* 2020-12-21: Team met to discuss Sprint Review and decide project direction
    * Team voted and decided to proceed with adding audio input and changing the light strip with an ML model
* 2020-12-28: Team met to draft, groom, and plan new PBIs for the new project direction
* 2020-12-29: DnD like the nerds we are :) 
* 2021-01-04: Weekly team meeting and assigning PBIs and Tech Report section drafts
* 2021-01-07: Weekly team meeting for status report and Tech Report review

## Findings
* Andy discovered that running the ML audio-light algorithm uses about 25% of the CPU (school laptop)
* Grace discovered that the ML model used in the demo relies on lyrics to detect valence
    * Believes that this was the cause of only one color being displayed during the sprint review demo

## Successes
* Team bonding
* No one got COVID over break!
* Selected a _specific_ and _actionable_ project direction!
    * We also have a laundry list of stuff to do afterwards if we type really fast!

## Risk Updates
* Project now has a reliance on ML which may be an issue if the team can't get stuff to work properly

# Questions
* Have you every played DnD?
* Are SEs just glorified typists and why is the answer 'yes'?

# Conclusion

The team has chosen a project direction and is ready to get to work!
