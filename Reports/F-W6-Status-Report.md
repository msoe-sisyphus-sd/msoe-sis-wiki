Comments made to issues in GitLab

-Added README instructions to Grace's PR explaining how to create a whichcson.js file

-Spent some time looking at the pipeline for the test project. The GitLab CI file looks correct but it looks like there is an issue with our Raspberry PI runner.

-Started looking at hooking up the lights and I got very confused by the electronics. I'm going to ask if any of my group members can help me.

-Meeting with the team to start the sprint 2 plan and to plan out finishing out PBIs for the sprint.

-Got the node testing framework setup with some basic tests added and I added a new node stage to the GitLab CI file.

-Made some progress with figuring out how to wire the lights but I'm still really confused. I reached out to George for some help.

-George guided me through setting up the lights circuit. Unfortunately it's still not working. I'll investigate more later.

-Brief investigation individually to see why the node pipeline was failing. Then I talked with Stuart later and he was able to fix the node pipeline.
