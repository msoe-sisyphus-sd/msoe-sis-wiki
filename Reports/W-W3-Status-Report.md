| 2020-12-16 | @casperjm | 3h | Continued fixing eslint errors, almost finished | #34 | msoe-siscloud |
| 2020-12-17 | @casperjm | 1.5h | Team meeting to write sprint report and status report | #7 | msoe-sisbot |

This week I started fixing the eslint errors in the siscloud repo. The first day, I did work setting up eslint and got some initial fixes down, the second day I went more in depth and fixed more errors. There are about a quarter of the initial errors remaining.

# Discussion

## Key Meetings

* 2020-12-11 - Met with Dr. Taylor to discuss sprint progress
* 2020-12-14 - Weekly Team Meeting for sprint update and Sprint 4 planning
* 2020-12-17 - Team meeting to finish sprint 3 documentation

## Findings
* Bruce gave the team a list of potential long-term projects 
    * HomeKit Integration / Android Home Automation Integration
    * Better Ambient Lighting
        * The team is a bit warry of this project since it seems to lack the depth of a long term project.
            * Machine learning to select lighting curve
            * Use camera instead of photo-resistor
            * External lighting module
* Audio input and output is possible with the lights running

## Successes
* Audio input can be used to adjust the brightness of the LEDs
* Implemented ML algorithm to generate colors based off WAV file
* The upstream was merged into our working repository

## Risk Updates
* Batteries can catch fire :fire:
    * Grace is cursed and therefore banned from the Cybersecurity lab (2 Yays, 1 Nay, 2 Abstains) /s

# Questions
* When should our technology report be due?
* Add Bruce and Matt as guests to team chat?

## Really Important Questions
* How are you (like really)?
* Which freshman SE do you hate the most?
* Which freshman SE do you like the most?
* Which major do you hate the most and why is it CE?

## Really Really Important Questions
* What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?

# Conclusion
All in all the team feels it has been a really good sprint. In addition to completing outstanding sprint work the team was able to investigate audio input and output while running the lights. Furthermore, the team was able to tackle DX (developer experience) debt with merging upstream changes into our working repository and clearing up `eslint` errors in `siscloud` and `sisproxy`.

Happy New Year :tada:
