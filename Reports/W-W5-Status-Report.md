# Discussion

## Key Meetings
* Friday 1/8: Met with Dr. Taylor to discuss project and risks associated with with the new direction. We also developed a new format for weekly sync meetings between the team and Dr. Taylor.
* Monday 1/11: sync meeting (missed by 2/5 of the team for various life issues). 
* Thursday 1/14: Status report meeting

## Findings
* Sisyphus app code is difficult to run.
* Documentation for team development process is poor.
* Physical audio features extracted from audio can be used to describe the mood of an audio/musical segment.

## Successes
* ML algorithm developed from demo works on Ubuntu 20.04 to effectively colorize music mood.
* Stuart got his light pattern working.

## Risk Updates
* Dr. Schilling performed a firmware upgrade to the lab topology. No abnormalities have been identified in network access, but it's something to be aware of.
* The ML algorithm being used is CPU-intensive and eats up 100% of a raspberry pi  4B+'s cpu.

# Questions
* Specific timeline for tech report?
* Is the due date for the self-guided learning in canvas actually accurate? (the 28th)

# Conclusion
The team remains excited about the project direction, and is currently considering multiple methods of implementation (pi vs. phone vs. external hardware under the table). The team plans to have a fully functioning demo as well as decision matrices for design decisions surrounding software/hardware considerations prepared for next week's sprint review.
