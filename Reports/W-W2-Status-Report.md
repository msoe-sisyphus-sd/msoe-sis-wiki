This week I finished up the holiday light pattern. I submitted my merge request and got a lot of feedback, so I spent some time polishing my code up before it was approved and merged. I will be picking up some tickets to work on that are outside of the sprint as I have nothing to work on at the moment

# Discussion


## Key Meetings
* 2020-12-07: We met as a team for sprint planning

## Findings
* We are capable of playing audio while using GPIO lights (using PCM for GPIO control, and PWM for audio output)

## Successes
* We finished 2 new light patterns and got the code reviewed
* Grace got the lights working again

## Risk Updates
* None here

# Questions

Is the usability testing student outcome assessment a team activity?

# Conclusion

Over the course of this week, we groomed our backlog after being away from this project for a while, we fixed issues we were having with the table, completed a knowledge acquisition and discussed next steps, completed two new light patterns, and planned a possible usability experiment to discover new potential features.
