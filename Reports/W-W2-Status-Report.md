# Questions

Is the usability testing student outcome assessment a team activity?

# Conclusion

Over the course of this week, we groomed our backlog after being away from this project for a while, we fixed issues we were having with the table, completed a knowledge acquisition and discussed next steps, completed two new light patterns, and planned a possible usability experiment to discover new potential features.
