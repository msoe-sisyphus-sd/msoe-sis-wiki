_As a reminder - we forgot to start the milestone on time so we adjusted the start date to give a more representative burn down chart._

| 2020-10-23 | burkhardtr | 30m | Met with Dr. Taylor for weekly advisor meeting. In this meeting we discussed the sprint review, the status of the sprint, student outcomes due the following week, and briefly touched the software components report and improvements that could be made to it. We also discussed the macro schedule of the project and the micro schedule of the next couple weeks (with Dr. Taylor's availability). | #7 | msoe-sisbot |
| 2020-10-26 | burkhardtr | 20m | Met with team to perform standup - not a lot went on. Briefly touched on Stuart's PR. | #7 | msoe-sisbot | 
| 2020-10-26 | burkhardr | 1h | Finished drafting the file and attempted to run it on the table but to no avail (I was remote). I think what was going wrong was I didn't have the right endpoint and I might need to build an object in the runtime to reference the file (or find the right schema). My plan is to tackle this with the table in person. | #23 | msoe-sisbot | 
| 2020-10-21 | burkhardtr | 2h | Fixed more ESLint errors. Again, I am spending a bit of time ensuring that the functionality is preserved. The code uses a lot of pre ES6 patterns (no classes), with `var` and `this` embedded in anonymous functions - this means that the functions can change at runtime so I need to trace the objects and ensure something like an unused variable isn't being called with from different calling context | #28 | msoe-sisbot
| 2020-10-29 | burkhardtr | 45m | Tried to put `eslint` in the test runner but due to some issues it was reset and was not live. I also spent time re-familiarizing myself with the gitlab-ci yml format and options for efficient execution (caching and such). | #28 | msoe-sisbot
| 2020-10-29 | burkhardtr | 30m | Was inspired by Bruce's comment about printing the time on the table with the track so I spent some time "sprint planning" and coming up with circular designs for printing time. I plan on refining the designs and uploading them to a new PBI for grooming. | #23 | msoe-sisbot
