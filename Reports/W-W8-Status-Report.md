# Discussion

## Key Meetings
* Meeting with Dr. Taylor 2021-01-29 to discuss first week
* Team meeting (stand up and check in) on 2021-02-01 - tasked out Usability testing
* Team meeting (status report and finalize Usability testing results) on 2021-02-04

## Findings
* Usability testing was planned and executed during this week. The team built out a series of mocks that extend the app's current functionality. Testing revealed weaknesses in the workflow and copy (verbiage). The team hopes to iterate on the design if it is going to be implemented. See https://gitlab.com/msoe.edu/sdl/sd21/sisyphus/msoe-sisbot/-/wikis/UX/Usability-Testing for more details

## Successes
* Integrating volume as a feature appears to be relatively trivial and should require minimum integration with the current implementation via RMS

## Risk Updates
* Audio capture on Android is really "fricken-chicken" hard
    * Biggest issues are memory allocation and junky audio buffer data (lots of 0s)
* Might need to remove the AI Service PBI (#49) with how work is being completed

# Questions
* Mind looking over a draft of our tech report (outside of Sprint Review) next week? We will send it out Monday night 2020-02-08 
* Do you like snow? :snowflake: 

# Conclusion
We are sick of righting conclusions 4 u bud - get offf our backs - we r doing werk and wii r louving it... :kissing: :heart: :computer:
