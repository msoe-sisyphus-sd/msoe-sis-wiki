Previous to the MSOE Sisyphus Design team’s intervention, a combination of robotics, magnetics, a marble ball and a Neopixel LED light strip were employed by Sisyphus Industries to create beautiful illuminated patterns on a kinetic art table. These patterns provide a deep sense of tranquility and meditation for the viewer. The MSOE Sisyphus Design Team has furthered the interactivity of this table by enabling the table’s lights to respond in both color and brightness to input audio mood and volume through a combination of machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the MSOE Sisyphus Design Team has produced further innovations in the space of R&D for Sisyphus Industries to explore in future attempts to increase the interactivity of the table, including an app to respond to phone notifications, new light patterns and new sand tracks.
