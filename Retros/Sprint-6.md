# Retrospective Sprint 6 :eyeglasses: 

## What We Wanted to Get Better At - Did it Happen?
> Assign someone to manage team bonding in a given week to ensure that it gets done

> Create weekly report documents before meetings to speed meetings up (person managing team bonding will also create these)

> Because we're approaching a more consistent in implementation we should start more testing efforts.

> Exposing members to all areas of the project.

> Closing old issues in GitLab that are no longer relevant. (@enters is take the lead on this)

We did get better and having team bonding during meetings. Also, we did get better at creating documents before meetings. The sprint 7 plan was created before the meeting but we didn't have all documents created. We also did get better with starting more testing efforts and we did get some automated tests in sislisten written. We also did get better with exposing members to all areas of the project. Joe got more exposure in sisbot and sislisten and Andy got more exposure in siscloud. Finally we also did get better with closing out old irrelevant issues and our backlog is now down to 8 issues.

## What We Wanted to Stop Doing - Did we stop?

> Forgetting to put carryover PBIs in the sprint plan

N/A since we didn't have carryover this sprint.

> Not marking implemented tasks as complete

We still feel like we could improve on this. We did not mark completed tasks as done in PBIs.

## What we should continue doing - How We Did

> Standups should continue to be descriptive but concise 

We did worse on this for this sprint. The team has ideas on how we could improve this.

> Continue meeting as a team to work on architecture related work

We did do this and we felt like meeting as a team for architecture allowed us to make really good progress on the architecture.

## What to Start Doing
* Have more async checkins with the team and sidebar longer issues during standup.
* Prepare retro points before retro to discuss with the team

## What to Stop Doing
* Merge parties on the day the sprint ends

## What We Should Continue Doing - New/Current
* Team Bonding activities
* Avoiding Senior Slide for Senior Design
