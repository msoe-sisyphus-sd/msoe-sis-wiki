# Retrospective :eyeglasses: 

## What we should start doing
* We should prep and break up end-of-sprint work so we aren't spending a lot of time the night before
* We should perform the retrospective _after_ the review
* We should log out time immediately after performing the work for better insight (@Stenters and @burkhardtr)

## What we should stop doing
* Logging negative time (?)
* Stop sporadically changing times of meetings the day of
   * Create a calendar invite for Thursday @flemingg

## What we should continue doing
* Standups and constant communication through the RATSM chat
* We should increase "synchronization" with other team members facing similar problems
    * e.g. Andy and George _did_ connect on wiring the lights instead of one party having to replicate research
