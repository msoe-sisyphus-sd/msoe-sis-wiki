Retrospective

The team retrospective is a time to reflect on how well the team is functioning. As a team you may chose to start with a brainstorming session and then narrow in on one or two items for each of the following:

* Things the team should start doing
* Things the team should stop doing
* Things the team should continue doing

These items should be summarized in the retrospective document for each sprint.
