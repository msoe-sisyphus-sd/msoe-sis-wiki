# Retrospective Sprint 4 :eyeglasses: 

## What We Wanted to Get Better At - Did it Happen?
> Regularly communicate PBI progress on shared PBI's (this isn't a problem right now, but the upcoming sprint will require close collaboration for team members).

We did this. We had multiple groups of people collaborating with the usability assessment and the architecture, the volume PBI, architecture, mobile, siscloud, and streaming PBI. There's always room for improvement and we're planning to continue to grow in this aspect.

> Get in touch with Matt about the siscloud startup issues/general inquiries about the architecture

This did not happen but we were able to solve some issues on our own and we plan on doing this next sprint.

> Attempt short (~5m) team bonding activity during weekly Monday meeting, to improve morale 

This did not happen. We're planning on having everyone rotate leading the team through a bonding activity during our Monday meetings starting with @burkhardt

> Recurring meeting invites (@flemingg)

We had one for Monday nights and we also had one for Thursdays. There were issues with the time being different the week of sprint reviews but it doesn't warrant carryover into next sprint.

## What We Wanted to Stop Doing - Did we stop?

> Thinking it's 2020, and logging time for last winter.

We got better with this.

> Stop planning entire sprint in 1 meeting (not a systemic issue, really just an issue in this sprint due to the spike nature of PBI's. This is listed more as a caution to upcoming sprints)

We did some asynchronous grooming this sprint which helped to speed up grooming as a team.

> Having hardware issues (continued)

We had no hardware issues this sprint

## What we should continue doing - How We Did

> Having Monday sync meetings

We continued having Monday sync meetings this sprint.

> Good team communication

We continued having Good team communication this sprint showcased by the many joint development and troubleshooting sessions this sprint.

## What to Start Doing
* Assign someone to manage team bonding in a given week to ensure that it gets done
* Create weekly report documents before meetings to speed meetings up (person managing team bonding will also create these)
* Because we're approaching a more consistent in implementation we should start more testing efforts.
* Exposing members to all areas of the project.

## What to Stop Doing
* Forgetting to put carryover PBIs in the sprint plan
* Not marking implemented tasks as complete

## What We Should Continue Doing - New/Current
* Standups should continue to be descriptive but concise 
* Continue meeting as a team to work on architecture related work
