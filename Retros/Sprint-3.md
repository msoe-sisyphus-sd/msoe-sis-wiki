# Retrospective Spring 3 :eyeglasses: 

## What We Wanted to Get Better At - Did it Happen?
> We should log out time immediately after performing the work for better insight -- continued

> Log status meetings with Dr. Taylor right after meeting, not days afterwards

> Improve automated testing; we have some work left to do on the repo before we can start creating tests as part of normal PBI workflow.

> Put in MR's for issues even if not ready to be merged (WIP). This lets people review earlier.

> For status reports, try to come with a summary/times/etc ready to paste into the report.

> Standardize remote development - write up a wiki article (?)

> Find out how to make our sprint outcomes more representative of work completed (add >1 person to a PBI, or create smaller PBI's).

> Get in touch with a teammate sooner if you encounter an issue, and don't be afraid to video call people; oftentimes this will be faster than just 

> Take more pictures on videocalls for the team scrapbook.

## What to Start Doing

## What We Wanted to Stop Doing - Did we stop?
> Don't create a new google doc every time we have a document, and actually use the team Drive.

> Merge parties; resolving merge requests throughout the sprint.

> Letting teammate's rommates get covid-19.

## What To Stop Doing

## What we should continue doing - How We Did
> Continue not logging negative time.

> We did a great job of scheduling meetings.

> Having fun & enjoying our project :) In spite of the frustrations and general stress of current circumstances, the team retains its enthusiasm for the project and strong team morale.

## What We Should Continue Doing - New/Current
