# Retrospective Spring 3 :eyeglasses: 

## What We Wanted to Get Better At - Did it Happen?
> We should log out time immediately after performing the work for better insight -- continued
* The team might have regressed (which we attribute to the term break)

> Log status meetings with Dr. Taylor right after meeting, not days afterwards
* The team did not accomplish this goal - we just live in a "go go go" world :shrug: :race_car: 

> Improve automated testing; we have some work left to do on the repo before we can start creating tests as part of normal PBI workflow.
* We added more linting but no testing

> Put in MR's for issues even if not ready to be merged (WIP). This lets people review earlier.
* The team feels like it did _fine_ but there is always room for improvement

> For status reports, try to come with a summary/times/etc ready to paste into the report.
* WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS!

> Standardize remote development - write up a wiki article (?)
* The team actually did pretty well with remote development this sprint

> Find out how to make our sprint outcomes more representative of work completed (add >1 person to a PBI, or create smaller PBI's).
* Tried adding more than one person (@flemingg and @burkhardtr on #15) to a PBI which worked somewhat well
    * Grace and George got misaligned halfway through the sprint so in future assignment the team should be cognizant to check-in with other assignees.
* WIP otherwise

> Get in touch with a teammate sooner if you encounter an issue, and don't be afraid to video call people; oftentimes this will be faster than just 
* We've been stan :kissing_heart: 

> Take more pictures on videocalls for the team scrapbook.
* No - taking pictures capture your soul and George doesn't have a soul so taking a picture of George is undefined behavior of the universe so in the hopes of not causing a universe wide segfault we have not taken any pictures.

## What to Start Doing
* 

## What We Wanted to Stop Doing - Did we stop?
> Don't create a new google doc every time we have a document, and actually use the team Drive.

> Merge parties; resolving merge requests throughout the sprint.

> Letting teammate's rommates get covid-19.

## What we should continue doing - How We Did
> Continue not logging negative time.

> We did a great job of scheduling meetings.

> Having fun & enjoying our project :) In spite of the frustrations and general stress of current circumstances, the team retains its enthusiasm for the project and strong team morale.

## What We Should Continue Doing - New/Current
