# Retrospective Sprint 8 :eyeglasses: 


## What We Wanted to Get Better At - Did it Happen?

> Daily asynchronous stand ups

No, we did not do daily async standups. Honestly, the team just forgot that we were going to do this. However, the team was still in constant contact with other members. The team feels we're allowed a mulligan and will try again this sprint!

> Marking subtasks as "done" as soon as the subtask is finished

Nope! It's really inconvenient to go back in and update this piece of the PBI. The team doesn't really use these to track work so it just doesn't fit in our workflow at the moment (better late then never in discovering this :) ) 

## What We Wanted to Stop Doing - Did we stop?

> Procrastinating

Some of the team feels they did better in not procrastinating - completing work. However, others on the team are still wrestling with their inner procrastination daemons ðŸ˜ˆ.

## What we should continue doing - How We Did

> Team bonding after meetings

We did really well with team bonding - we made sure to do non-school, non-senior-design activities after meetings to reduce the feeling of burnout.

> Async grooming

We didn't do a ton of grooming this sprint, however the PBIs that we did have on deck were decently written out prior to meetings (from past grooming sessions).

> Not contributing to the police state

You know, our project may not be super flashy (because we fixed that in a previous PBI), but at least we aren't tracking people by their gait and assuming the worst of people. Like yes, we are recording private audio and passing it to an AI service but that's all voluntary and does not have any ethical implications about mis-identification of innocent persons :microphone: :arrow_down: 

## What to Start Doing

* Daily Asynchronous Standup (for real this time)

* Test changes in a table environment sooner

* Senior Sprinting :checkered_flag: :runner: 

We are _totally_ going to be so _fully engaged_ with this final sprint - just you see. Like we're gonna rewrite the whole project from scratch in Rust and Clojure. You may have you'rre doubts, but we're v speedy bois. :fish: 

## What to Stop Doing

* Attempting to mark sub-tasks done

It doesn't fit with our flow and it is honestly a hinderance on our process. Daily Asynchronous Standup should solve the issue of tracking and understanding low-level work completion

* Merge Parties

They crept back in during this sprint and we want to send them to kingdom come in this final sprint

* Last-minute Sprint Work

We hope that during our final retrospective and team meeting that we only need to meet to fill out paper work and all sprint work is completed well before the deadline.


## What We Should Continue Doing - New/Current

* Communication

* Vaccinations :syringe:
