## Sprint 9 Plan :tada: :mortar_board: :fire: 

### Sprint Goal:



### Sprint Assumptions

* Each of the 5 members of the team will be putting in an average of 10 hours/week
* Git flow will be followed as posted
* PBI's will only be moved to completion when they satisfy the [Definition of Done](/msoe.edu/sdl/sd21/sisyphus/msoe-sisbot/-/wikis/Process/Definition%20of%20Done)
* The table in the Cybersecurity lab is set up for remote development.
* We will not be doing another sprint after this one :sob: 

### Selected PBI's (ordered by priority)

Ambitious but let's go:

| PBI Number | Business Value | Story-points | Time Estimates | 
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| #64 | Maintain the customizability of the table with new services | 8 | 12h |
| #47 | Support custom colors for moods in the user interface | 5 | 12h |
| #66 | Improve user settings functionality | 5 | 12h | 
| #50 | Explore beat detection as an option for users | 8 | 11h |
