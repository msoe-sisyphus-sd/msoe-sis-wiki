## Sprint 9 Plan :tada: :mortar_board: :fire: 

### Sprint Goal:
Finalize mood lighting color settings and smoothing and enable beat detection.

#### Did We Meet Our Goal?
No, we were only able to polish mood lighting but ran into library issues (i.e. lack of documentation,  buggy implementation loading files) with PyAudioAnalysis' beat detection module. Seems like this part of the library has not been used by others - there was a distinct lack of examples online.

### Sprint Assumptions

* Each of the 5 members of the team will be putting in an average of 10 hours/week
* Git flow will be followed as posted
* PBI's will only be moved to completion when they satisfy the [Definition of Done](/msoe.edu/sdl/sd21/sisyphus/msoe-sisbot/-/wikis/Process/Definition%20of%20Done)
* The table in the Cybersecurity lab is set up for remote development.
* We will not be doing another sprint after this one :sob: 

### Selected PBI's (ordered by priority)

Ambitious but let's go:

| PBI Number | Business Value | Story-points | Time Estimates | Completed? | Carry Over? |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |------------|-------------|
| #64 | Maintain the customizability of the table with new services | 8 | 12h | x | x |
| #47 | Support custom colors for moods in the user interface | 5 | 12h | x | x |
| #66 | Improve user settings functionality | 5 | 12h | x | |
| #50 | Explore beat detection as an option for users | 8 | 11h | | |

## Velocity Analysis
