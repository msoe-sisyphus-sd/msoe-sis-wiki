## Sprint 2 Plan

### Sprint Goal:

Continue exploring different light patterns and being investigating additional inputs to affect lighting schemes.

_May change depending on feedback from product owner meeting 2020-10-16._

### Sprint Assumptions

* Each of the 5 members of the team will be putting in an average of 10 hours/week
* Git flow will be followed as posted
* PBI's will only be moved to completion when they satisfy the [Definition of Done](/msoe.edu/sdl/sd21/sisyphus/msoe-sisbot/-/wikis/Process/Definition%20of%20Done)
* The table is set up for development and each member has at least a partial local environment to operate within
