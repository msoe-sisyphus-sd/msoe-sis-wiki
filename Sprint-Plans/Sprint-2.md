## Sprint 2 Plan

### Sprint Goal:

Continue exploring different light patterns and being investigating additional inputs to affect lighting schemes.

_May change depending on feedback from product owner meeting 2020-10-16._

### Sprint Assumptions

* Each of the 5 members of the team will be putting in an average of 10 hours/week
* Git flow will be followed as posted
* PBI's will only be moved to completion when they satisfy the [Definition of Done](/msoe.edu/sdl/sd21/sisyphus/msoe-sisbot/-/wikis/Process/Definition%20of%20Done)
* The table is set up for development and each member has at least a partial local environment to operate within

### Selected PBI's (ordered by priority)

The table below are Sprint 2 PBIs ordered by priority

| PBI Number | Business Value | Story-points | Time Estimates | Completed?|
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |---|
| #25 | Enable developers to quickly build and test new light sequences by enabling remote development. | 5 | 5h | |
| #28 | Improve maintainability of code base and help catch errors before code is deployed to the table. | 3 | 7h | X |
| #23 | Create a new erase track to keep tracks interesting | 2 | 4h | X|
| #17 | Create a dynamic light pattern that changes with the weather | 5 | 18h | X |
| #13 | Create a festive light pattern that uses special color schemes for holidays | 5 | 6h | |
| #19 | Develop a light pattern that will provide a new visualization for the ball | 8 | 16h| |
| #20 | Investigate new interactions between the user and the table's lights | 8 | 13.5h | X |
