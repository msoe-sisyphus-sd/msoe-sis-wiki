## Sprint 5 Plan

### Sprint Goal:
Determine where the modified (volume-sensitive) algorithm for translating audio to color will run.

### Sprint Assumptions

* Each of the 5 members of the team will be putting in an average of 10 hours/week
* Git flow will be followed as posted
* PBI's will only be moved to completion when they satisfy the [Definition of Done](/msoe.edu/sdl/sd21/sisyphus/msoe-sisbot/-/wikis/Process/Definition%20of%20Done)
* The table in the Cybersecurity lab is set up for remote development.
* There is no carryover from the previous sprint

### Selected PBI's (ordered by priority)
The table below are Sprint 2 PBIs ordered by priority


| PBI Number | Business Value | Story-points | Time Estimates | 
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| #49 | Investigate alternative method of accepting audio | 5 | 15h | 
| #45 | Investigate using a mobile phone as a platform for running audio-color algorithm | 8 | 27h|
| #46 | Good systems begin with good architecture | 13 | 50h |
| #48 | This adds volume sensitivity to the algorithm, important for matching the ambience of a room | 3 | 7h |

*_note that all team members will be participating in #46; as such the point value and time estimate reflect this effort._
