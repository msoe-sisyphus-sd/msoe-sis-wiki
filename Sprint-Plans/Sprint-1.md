## Sprint 1 Plan

### Sprint Goal: 
Finish off any zero-day items for setup and develop simple yet creative light sequences to demonstrate setup completion.

### Sprint Assumptions
* Each of the 5 members of the team will be putting in an average of 10 hours/week.
* Git flow will be followed as posted
* PBI's will only be moved to completion when they satisfy the [Definition of Done](Process/Definition of Done)
* The table is set up for development.
