## Sprint 3 Plan

### Sprint Goal:

Finish off carryover from sprint 2, and explore methods of input for lighting dependent on physical environment.

_May change depending on feedback from product owner meeting 2020-11-6._

### Sprint Assumptions

* Each of the 5 members of the team will be putting in an average of 10 hours/week
* Git flow will be followed as posted
* PBI's will only be moved to completion when they satisfy the [Definition of Done](/msoe.edu/sdl/sd21/sisyphus/msoe-sisbot/-/wikis/Process/Definition%20of%20Done)
* The table in the Cybersecurity lab is set up for remote development

### Selected PBI's (ordered by priority)

The table below are Sprint 2 PBIs ordered by priority

| PBI Number | Business Value | Story-points | Time Estimates | Finished? |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |---|
| #25 | Enable developers to quickly build and test new light sequences by enabling remote development. | 5 | 2h |  Yes |
| #13 | Create a festive light pattern that uses special color schemes for holidays | 5 | 4h | Yes |
| #19 | Develop a light pattern that will provide a new visualization for the ball | 8 | 8h | ? |
| #15 | Explore new mediums of expression for the table | 5 | 8h| Yes |
| #30 | Create a light pattern that responds to both ball's theta and rho position | 5 | 13h | Yes |

Added later:
| PBI Number | Business Value | Story-points | Time Estimates | Finished? |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |---|
| #38 | Ensure MSOE senior design code is forward-compatible with Sisyphus production code | 2 | 4h |  Yes |
| #34 | Ensure code style is clean and maintainable | 3 | 10h | No |

If we finish the above, we will plan to pull in the following:

| PBI Number | Business Value | Story-points | Time Estimates | 
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| #31 | Explore methods for users to interact with the table beyond app| 13 | 20h |
| #29 | Create a track/time integration requested by users (source: Bruce) | 13 | 15h |
