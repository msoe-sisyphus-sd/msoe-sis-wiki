## Sprint 4 Plan

### Sprint Goal:
Investigate two new user-table domains to test feasibility and level of interactivity.

_May change depending on feedback from product owner meeting 2020-12-18._

### Sprint Assumptions

* Each of the 5 members of the team will be putting in an average of 10 hours/week
* Git flow will be followed as posted
* PBI's will only be moved to completion when they satisfy the [Definition of Done](/msoe.edu/sdl/sd21/sisyphus/msoe-sisbot/-/wikis/Process/Definition%20of%20Done)
* The table in the Cybersecurity lab is set up for remote development.
* There is no carryover from the previous sprint
