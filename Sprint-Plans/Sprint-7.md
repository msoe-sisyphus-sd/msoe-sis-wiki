## Sprint 7 Plan

### Sprint Goal:
Expand functional proof-of-concept mood lighting to production-ready prototype.

### Sprint Assumptions

* Each of the 5 members of the team will be putting in an average of 10 hours/week
* Git flow will be followed as posted
* PBI's will only be moved to completion when they satisfy the [Definition of Done](/msoe.edu/sdl/sd21/sisyphus/msoe-sisbot/-/wikis/Process/Definition%20of%20Done)
* The table in the Cybersecurity lab is set up for remote development.
* There is no carryover from the previous sprint

### Selected PBI's (ordered by priority)
The table below are the Sprint's PBIs ordered by priority


| PBI Number | Business Value | Story-points | Time Estimates | Completed | 
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- | --------- |
| #62 | Deploy the AI service on a platform where performance and availability can be maximized | 8 | 15h | N |
| #63 | Production table should be able to run mood lighting with added hardware package. | 5 | 11h | Y |
