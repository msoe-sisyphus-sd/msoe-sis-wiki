### Sprint Assumptions

* Each of the 5 members of the team will be putting in an average of 10 hours/week
* Git flow will be followed as posted
* PBI's will only be moved to completion when they satisfy the [Definition of Done](/msoe.edu/sdl/sd21/sisyphus/msoe-sisbot/-/wikis/Process/Definition%20of%20Done)
* The table in the Cybersecurity lab is set up for remote development.
* There is no carryover from the previous sprint
