# Retrospective Spring 2 :eyeglasses: 

## What We Wanted to Get Better At - Did it Happen?
> We should prep and break up end-of-sprint work so we aren't spending a lot of time the night before
* We did better at this! We had a sprint planning meeting on Wednesday before the new sprint started, so we offloaded some pre-sprint-start work.
> We should perform the retrospective _after_ the review
* Taylor said no :cry:
> We should log out time immediately after performing the work for better insight
* Some people did better at this, some people did worse.

## What to Start Doing
* We should log out time immediately after performing the work for better insight -- continued
* Log status meetings with Dr. Taylor right after meeting, not days afterwards
* Improve automated testing; we have some work left to do on the repo before we can start creating tests as part of normal PBI workflow.
* Put in MR's for issues even if not ready to be merged (WIP). This lets people review earlier.
* For status reports, try to come with a summary/times/etc ready to paste into the report.
* Standardize remote development - write up a wiki article (?)
  * Treat as action item from the retro
* Find out how to make our sprint outcomes more representative of work completed (add >1 person to a PBI, or create smaller PBI's).
  * Follow up with Taylor on this
* Get in touch with a teammate sooner if you encounter an issue, and don't be afraid to video call people; oftentimes this will be faster than just 
* Take more pictures on videocalls for the team scrapbook.
  * @George remember to smile

## What We Wanted to Stop Doing - Did we stop?
> Logging negative time (?)
* YAY! No negative time logs.
> Stop sporadically changing times of meetings the day of
* YAY! No sporadic scheduling changes

## What To Stop Doing
* Don't create a new google doc every time we have a document, and actually use the team Drive.
  * @flemingg
* Merge parties; resolving merge requests throughout the sprint.
* Letting teammate's rommates get covid-19.

## What we should continue doing - How We Did
> Standups and constant communication through the RATSM chat
* Good!
> We should increase "synchronization" with other team members facing similar problems
* Could use some improvements -- see under "Start Doing" section.

## What We Should Continue Doing - New/Current
* Continue not logging negative time.
* We did a great job of scheduling meetings.
* Having fun & enjoying our project :) In spite of the frustrations and general stress of current circumstances, the team retains its enthusiasm for the project and strong team morale.
