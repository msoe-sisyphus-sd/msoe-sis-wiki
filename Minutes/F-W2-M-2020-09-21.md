### Definition of Done Draft

A PBI will be considered "Done" when
    * any code changes are merged into `master` branch
    * the work has been verified with the Product Owner
    * the work has been reviewed by the developer and 2 additional team members (see [Git Flow](/Process/Git Flow)
    * all tests have passed
    * the work meets the acceptance criteria
    * appropriate tests (at least 1) have been written to test the code changes
    * code analyzers and linters ensure the code has not regressed and is within an acceptable range of "cleanness" 
        * If `ESLint` is used: no warnings and no errors
        * If `pylint` is used: the score should not be below 8 / 10

_The term testing is kept intentionally vague as to not specify whether the test is manual or automated due to the nature of the technologies, APIs, and current testing methodology._
