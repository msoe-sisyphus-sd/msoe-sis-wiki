# Student Outcome 6-3: Usability Testing

## What is Usability Testing?
Usability testing is a form of product-user interaction testing in which users interacting with a product are monitored. Both qualitative and quantitative data are collected (for instance, the amount of time a user takes to complete a series of steps, and how they felt about the process). This data is used to explore new features, repair existing pain points or discover how users actually use a project.

## What We Plan To Test
What we are planning to test is the existing state of the Sisyphus table and its associate mobile/web application. By monitoring users who are interacting with the table, the team's goal would be to identify new areas of interaction between the user and the table, potentially leading to new features.

## How We Plan To Test
We plan to test by first contacting Dr. Bruce Shapiro from Sisyphus industries for a summary of user personas that they see purchasing the table (hobbyists, corporations, etc.). Then, we plan to recruit some focus groups along the lines of these groups and observe them playing with the table. 

Considerations will be made in terms of the coronavirus pandemic.Testing will be conducted remotely, using a port-forwarded web server and a video stream running of the table. This is not a one-to-one substitute for in-person usability testing, but we believe this is a safe compromise that will still deliver valuable information.

## Tasks to Facilitate Testing
- [ ] Get in touch with Dr. Shapiro about user personas
- [ ] Ask Jared to port-forward the web interface from the Cyber lab to the MSOE network.
- [ ] Recruit members fitting personas
- [ ] Schedule times to observe personas
- [ ] Take part in life persona usage sessions, and record data.
- [ ] Analyze the data to see if new features or use cases can be derived.
