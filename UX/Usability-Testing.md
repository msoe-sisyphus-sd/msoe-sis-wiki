# Goal
The team has chosen to proceed with mapping audio to colors and with this comes updates to the Sisyphus app's settings and new controls and visualizations. The goal of this usability test is to validate a potential design for added controls to the existing Sisyphus mobile app (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sisyphus-app/id1225581226#?platform=iphone)

## Persona

### Background
Sandra was gifted the table last Christmas after falling in love with it on social media. She is somewhat technically inclined, working with computers at her job and on her iPhone when at home, but does not know much about the internals of the table. She loves watching the table and sharing it on her Instagram. She would love to share videos of interacting with the table - especially the lights. She has only interacted with the Sisyphus app a bare minimum to set up the table.

## Workflows/Scenarios
1. The user shall be able to navigate to the **Settings** screen in order to **enable** and/or **disable** the music-light mode after opening the app.
2. The user shall be able to update the 4 colors used in the music-light mode to suit their aesthetic preference.
3. The user shall be able to change the music features that impact the color axes.
4. The user shall be able to navigate to the **Settings** screen in order to **enable** and/or **disable** beat matching mode after opening the app.

# Data

## Testing Procedure (~10min.)
1. Schedule time with user (they will need access to a computer)
2. Thank them for meeting with you
3. Introduce them to the Sisyphus Table if they are unfamiliar and the new features we are adding
4. Describe the usability testing process (make sure you let them know to think out loud and be as picky as possible - **WE ARE TESTING THE DESIGNS, NOT THE USERS**)
5. Send them the link to the Mock-ups/Prototype (make sure they share their screen with you if this is conducted remotely)
6. Ask them "How would you enable the new music-light color mode?"
7. Record what they click, any notable pauses, delays, quick clicks, etc.
8. _From the same screen_, ask them "How would you see the current color as it relates to the music?"
9. Record what they click, any notable pauses, delays, quick clicks, etc.
10. _From the same screen_, ask them "How might you change the possible colors that the music could map to?"
11. Record what they click, any notable pauses, delays, quick clicks, etc.
12. _From the same screen_, ask them "Currently the table uses the music's emotion and energy to change the color but, there are additional music features that can be used to change the color. How might you enable one of those other features instead of emotion?
13. Record what they click, any notable pauses, delays, quick clicks, etc.
14. _From the same screen_, ask them "How might you enable the lights to pulse with the beat of the music of the table?"
15. Record what they click, any notable pauses, delays, quick clicks, etc.
16. Thank the user for participating - ask if we may contact them for further testing (if we chose to iterate on the designs) 

If the user gets stuck - ask them what they are stuck on. Try to hint at the goal (e.g. if the user doesn't know how to change the table behavior - you might say "the Settings page controls what the table can currently do")

_Please note that this is a general structure of a testing session and the questions can be re-worded to be more clear._

### Notes
- Changing the analysis features was understood but she did not understood what some of the features were.
- The user was able to enable both the Music-Color mode and the beat mode with no issues.
- The user seemed confused with the grid visualization with how the different features are determined.
- The user asked "why is there a sad emotion if I'm sad then I don't want to dwell on it and I would want my table to lift me up or be calming"
- Liked the color wheel to pick a new feature color
- Also, liked that the table would be able to pulse with the beat.

### Notes
> "How would you enable the new music-light color mode"

She started from Home, went to Settings, then tried to find it under the Lighting Mode dropdown. After telling her that the new feature is based around audio, she found the checkbox and checked it.

> "How would you see the current color as it relates to the music?"

She looked at the color map and pointed to the white dot on the graph.

> "How might you change the possible colors that the music could map to?"

She clicked on the graph, then clicked on the color wheel to select a new color. It didn't do anything because changing colors isn't built into it, but she had the right idea. After clicking on the color wheel, she clicked accept. 

> "Currently the table uses the music's emotion and energy to change the color but, there are additional music features that can be used to change the color. How might you enable one of those other features instead of emotion?"

She scrolled up and down trying to find a settings button for the mood lighting features, but then saw that it was in the dropdown below the graph. She clicked the X axis dropdown and selected the flux setting. 

> "How might you enable the lights to pulse with the beat of the music of the table?"

She quickly found and clicked the pulse lights with audio checkbox.

### Notes
> "How would you enable the new music-light color mode"

Subject moved towards the controls for track and said "well, I'd control the music from here, right?" I said, "Well, the lights respond to the audio being played in the room. The app doesn't necessarily play the music." The subject said, "That's so confusing." I eventually guided the subject to the settings screen.

> "How would you see the current color as it relates to the music?"

The subject was very confused about what this meant. The subject expected the ball to be draggable and the app to pick a color for the music based on how he dragged the ball (a polarity of mood offset?). Assumes that the colors respond to the mood of the person and not the mood of the music.

> "How might you change the possible colors that the music could map to?"

See above--this was a similar conversation. The subject found the correct checkbox to enable the mode, but struggled greatly to correlate the colors to a mood. Asked why they would change a color to match a mood.

> "Currently the table uses the music's emotion and energy to change the color but, there are additional music features that can be used to change the color. How might you enable one of those other features instead of emotion?"

 _Ended not being able to test due to the course of the conversation, as the subject enabled the next check and said "well this makes a lot more sense!"_

> "How might you enable the lights to pulse with the beat of the music of the table?"

Subject checked box without issue.
