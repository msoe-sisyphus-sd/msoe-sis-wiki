The team has chosen to proceed with mapping audio to colors and with this comes updates to the Sisyphus app's settings and new controls and visualizations. The goal of this usability test is to validate a potential design for added controls to the existing Sisyphus mobile app (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sisyphus-app/id1225581226#?platform=iphone)
